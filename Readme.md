Superposition - idea that allows for qubits to exist in multiple states, particles can be in multiple states at once.

Quantum entanglement - Where two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.

Von Neumann Architecture
Stored-Program Concept: Von Neumann’s architecture is based on the idea that both data and instructions are stored in the same memory. This allows the computer to be reprogrammed without altering its hardware1.
Single Memory Space: Both instructions and data share the same memory and pathways, which simplifies the design but can lead to bottlenecks1.
Sequential Execution: Instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed one at a time, which can limit speed due to the "von Neumann bottleneck"1.
Turing’s Universal Machine
Abstract Model: Turing’s concept of a universal machine is more theoretical. It describes a machine that can simulate any other machine given the correct algorithm and sufficient time2.
Algorithmic Focus: Turing’s work laid the groundwork for understanding algorithms and computation, emphasizing the logical structure of computation rather than physical implementation2.
Flexibility: The Turing machine is a model for what can be computed, providing a foundation for the theory of computation and influencing the development of programming languages2.
Key Differences
Practical vs. Theoretical: Von Neumann’s architecture is a practical design for building computers, while Turing’s machine is a theoretical model that defines the limits of what can be computed21.
Memory Structure: Von Neumann’s architecture uses a single memory for both data and instructions, leading to potential bottlenecks. Turing’s model doesn’t specify memory structure but focuses on the logical steps of computation1.
Impact on Modern Computing: Von Neumann’s architecture directly influenced the design of most modern computers, while Turing’s ideas underpin the theoretical aspects of computer science
