Key Characteristics of RISC:
Simplified Instructions: Each instruction is designed to execute in a single clock cycle, which simplifies the processor design and can lead to higher performance.
Load/Store Architecture: Data processing operations are performed only on registers, with separate instructions for loading data from memory into registers and storing data back to memory.
Fixed Instruction Length: Instructions are typically of a uniform length, which simplifies instruction decoding and pipelining.
Large Number of Registers: RISC architectures often have a large number of general-purpose registers to reduce the frequency of memory access.

Key Characteristics of CISC:
Complex Instructions: CISC processors have a large number of instructions, some of which can perform multi-step operations or complex tasks within a single instruction.
Variable Instruction Length: Instructions can vary in length, which can make decoding more complex but allows for more flexible and powerful instructions.
Fewer Registers: Compared to RISC architectures, CISC processors typically have fewer general-purpose registers.
Microcode: Many CISC instructions are implemented using microcode, which translates complex instructions into simpler, lower-level operations within the CPU.

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a critical component of the CPU responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. Here are its main functions:

Arithmetic Operations
Addition: Adding two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracting one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiplying two numbers.
Division: Dividing one number by another.
Logical Operations
AND: Performing a logical AND operation.
OR: Performing a logical OR operation.
NOT: Performing a logical NOT operation.
XOR: Performing a logical XOR operation.
Bitwise Operations
Shift Left: Shifting bits to the left.
Shift Right: Shifting bits to the right.
Rotate: Rotating bits left or right.
Comparison Operations
Equal To: Checking if two values are equal.
Less Than: Checking if one value is less than another.
Greater Than: Checking if one value is greater than another.
Role in CPU
Data Processing: The ALU processes data from the registers and memory, performing the necessary calculations and logical operations.
Instruction Execution: It executes the instructions provided by the control unit, which directs the ALU on which operations to perform.

Superposition - idea that allows for qubits to exist in multiple states, particles can be in multiple states at once.

Quantum entanglement - Where two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.

Von Neumann Architecture
Stored-Program Concept: Von Neumann’s architecture is based on the idea that both data and instructions are stored in the same memory. This allows the computer to be reprogrammed without altering its hardware1.
Single Memory Space: Both instructions and data share the same memory and pathways, which simplifies the design but can lead to bottlenecks1.
Sequential Execution: Instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed one at a time, which can limit speed due to the "von Neumann bottleneck"1.
Turing’s Universal Machine
Abstract Model: Turing’s concept of a universal machine is more theoretical. It describes a machine that can simulate any other machine given the correct algorithm and sufficient time2.
Algorithmic Focus: Turing’s work laid the groundwork for understanding algorithms and computation, emphasizing the logical structure of computation rather than physical implementation2.
Flexibility: The Turing machine is a model for what can be computed, providing a foundation for the theory of computation and influencing the development of programming languages2.
Key Differences
Practical vs. Theoretical: Von Neumann’s architecture is a practical design for building computers, while Turing’s machine is a theoretical model that defines the limits of what can be computed21.
Memory Structure: Von Neumann’s architecture uses a single memory for both data and instructions, leading to potential bottlenecks. Turing’s model doesn’t specify memory structure but focuses on the logical steps of computation1.
Impact on Modern Computing: Von Neumann’s architecture directly influenced the design of most modern computers, while Turing’s ideas underpin the theoretical aspects of computer science

0b6 - 0b8

6 = 0110 
Finding the two complement of 8 = 1000 = 0111 = 1000 (add trailing one to 0111)

0110 - 1000 = 1110 (answer given as -2 in twos complement form)
